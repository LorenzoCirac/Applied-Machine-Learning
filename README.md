Welcome to my **Applied Machine Learning Bachelor Practical Course** repository! 🎓🤖 This repository documents my journey through a **10-week** hands-on course, where I implemented fundamental machine learning concepts **from scratch**.  

## 📌 About the Course  
- **Duration**: 10 weeks  
- **Exercises**: 10 projects covering key ML concepts   
- **Starting Point**: Complete beginner — this repository reflects my learning process and improvements over time   

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
Throughout the course, I used:  
- **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/)** – Linear algebra & numerical operations  
- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** – Data manipulation & analysis  
- **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)** – Visualization & plotting  
- **[Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)** – Reference implementation for ML algorithms  

## 🚀 What I Learned  
- How ML algorithms work under the hood 🔍  
- Writing efficient implementations using NumPy  
- Understanding model evaluation & hyperparameter tuning  
- Comparing custom implementations with Scikit-Learn
